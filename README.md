# tuDHM
tuDHM is a Matlab implementation developed by the Optical Imaging Research Laboratory from the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of Memphis. tuDHM App is a free user-friendly tool, providing a universal strategy for reconstructing in telecentric, single-shot digital holographic microscopy (DHM). This implementation is based on a fast and automatic method based on the minimization of a cost function that finds the best numerical conjugated reference beam to compensate the filtered object information, eliminating any undesired phase perturbation due to the tilt between the reference and object waves. The novelties of the proposed approach are accurate reconstructed phase images, and reduced processing time.
