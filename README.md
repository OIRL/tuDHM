# tuDHM
tuDHM is a Matlab implementation developed by the Optical Imaging Research Laboratory from the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of Memphis. tuDHM App is a free user-friendly tool, providing a universal strategy for compensating the interference angle between the reference and object waves in an off-axis (i.e., single-shot)  digital holographic microscopy (DHM) operating in telecentric mode. The tuDHM method reconstructs phase maps with reduced phase distortions. This implementation is based on a fast and automatic method based on the minimization of a cost function that finds the best numerical conjugated reference beam to compensate the filtered object information, eliminating any undesired phase perturbation due to the tilt between the reference and object waves. The novelties of the proposed approach are reconstructed phase images with reduced phase distortions, and reduced processing time.
