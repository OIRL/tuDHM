## tuDHM
### Fast, automatic and accurate method 

tuDHM is an algorithm to recover the complex object information for a single-shot digital holographic microscope (DHM) operating in the telecentric regimen. The algoritm is based on the minimization of a cost function that finds the best numerical conjugated reference beam to compensate the filtered object information, eliminating any undesired phase perturbation due to the tilt between the reference and object waves.
