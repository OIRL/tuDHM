## tuDHM 

tuDHM is an algorithm to recover the complex object information for a single-shot digital holographic microscope (DHM) operating in the telecentric regimen. The algoritm is based on the minimization of a cost function that finds the best numerical conjugated reference beam to compensate the filtered object information, eliminating any undesired phase perturbation due to the tilt between the reference and object waves. 

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/OIRL/tuDHM/edit/gh-pages/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/OIRL/tuDHM/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
