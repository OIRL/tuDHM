## tuDHM
### Fast, automatic and accurate method 

tuDHM is an algorithm to recover the complex object information for a single-shot digital holographic microscope (DHM) operating in the telecentric regimen. The algoritm is based on the minimization of a cost function that finds the best numerical conjugated reference beam to compensate the filtered object information, eliminating any undesired phase perturbation due to the tilt between the reference and object waves. 

### Methods of use

We have develop two implementation, tuDHM for developers that allow to research work with direct with the .m files of matlab and a GUI version for people that not have knoledge about matlab.

### tuDHM developers
This version is addressed to developers or research with Matlab knowledge. The version contain seven function where the main function is called tuDHM.m


To work with `tuDHM.m` the user should read the hologram, and input the initial parameters [lambda, pixel sizes in both axis (x,y)]

### tDHM GUI
This version contains a GUI friendly that is focus for anyone that required obtain the numerica phase reconstruction of holograms without knowledge of Matlab platform.
